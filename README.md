The exercise materials did not include the icons and images required for the page. As I was unsure whether this was deliberate, I decided to display the icons in two ways:
1) buy cutting the images out of the main image with an image editing application
2) by using the main image as a background sprite

The idea is simply to demonstrate that the problem can be tacked in several ways.
